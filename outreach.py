# the plan for this file is to be the client and server functionality in one. it should run at
# startup and close itself if no controller is connected to the bot. if a controller is connected, then
# it will send controller commands straight to the arduino
#
# functionality is mostly there but won't work as committed on 3/12/2018
#
# should be installed to autorun on pi for the bot once completed

# 0: Left stick's left-to-right. Left is -1, right is 1
# 1: Left stick's up-to-down. Up is -1, down is 1
# **When the mode light on the controller is red

# The buttons are straightforward. Each button has a number on it, n, and
# and number that represents in in the code, m.

# don't go to competition without verifying the controller works the way it is expected to
